Once upon a time... ok, skip that:

My name is Jan Krag, and I'm a software developer from Copenhagen, Denmark.
Many things may be added, but I will start with those details that are in just some way relevant to how, in 2014, I finally got to the point where it was long overdue to start this blog.

## Absolutely not a resum√© 
Ever since finishing in the field of Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark in 1997, I have spent my professional life as a software developer, mainly working with Java, in various companies, working with anything from e-commerce, dot.com boom era websites, library systems, healthcare, medico, and the last 7 years in a company called Schantz, building software solutions for pension funds and life insurance companies. 

Apart from working with Java, I have also had the chance to do a little Scala development at work as well.

## Hungry for knowledge
I have always been curious in  nature, but as with many things in life, the level of spare energy that can be thrown into pursuing new knowledge, varies with time and other life challenges.
After going through a more passive phase some years ago, I seem to have taken a junction somewhere, and the last couple of years have been a roller coaster of learning, bringing me to many different corners of the computer science field. 

This ongoing journey was somehow initialised by an inner hunger for learning that bubbled up on a feeling of professional 'stagnation' following nearly 15 years of Java development. It was further kickstarted, to a noticeable degree, when I attended the fabulous Devoxx 2011 conference in Antwerp, and following that, has been greatly helped along by the uprise of especially Coursera shortly thereafter.

## Hobbies

Apart from being a computer since geek, I have a number of other hobbies, and I am sure some of these will sneak their way into future corners of this blog.

One of these, however, is probably worth mentioning a little bit about, as it has a direct connection the project that will be the subject of my first few blogposts.

## Of cats and genetics
For the last nearly 20 years, I have owned and breed pedigree cats (Norwegian Forest Cats, Bengals, Oriental shorthairs, and now focusing on Oriental Longhairs).
Branching of from this hobby, I have also taken an interest in feline genetics, and have been teaching cat genetics together with my wife for many years.

This interest in cat genetics actually goes back so far, that I actually did my CS master thesis on building a database and web-interface for cat pedigrees and doing automated inference of the cats genotypes (genetic composition) based on available information on colours etc.

The implementation of my thesis was done using Oracle DB and I did the entire front-end in PL/SQL stored procedures generating HTML _(don't go there)_.

Ever since, I have had a desire to some day re-invent the whole thing in more modern technologies. Around 2000'ish I hacked up a primitive version in PHP/MySQL for my own cattery homepage, which however, apart from being crap, mainly contained our own cats and their descendants (< 1000). 

Now, mainly inspired by my investigations in graph databases (or was it the other way around), I have started a project to build a pedigree system again, partly because of the actual desire to have it, and partly as a perfect platform for testing many of the new technologies I come across.
