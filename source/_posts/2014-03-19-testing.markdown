### Lists ###

Itemized lists look like:

~~~
* Bullet list item 1
* Bullet list item 2
~~~

* Bullet list item 1
* Bullet list item 2

1. Numbered list item
2. Numbered list item
42. You don't need to number properly

Definition list term 1

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above). Here's a link to [a
website](http://foo.bar). Here's a link to a [local
doc](local-doc.html). Here's a footnote [^1].

Tables can look like this:
| First cell|Second cell|Third cell
| First | Second | Third |

First | Second | | Fourth |

size  material      color
----  ------------  ------------
9     leather       brown
10    hemp canvas   natural
11    glass         transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!
tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Alternately, put blank lines in
between each of the above definition list lines to spread things
out more.)
