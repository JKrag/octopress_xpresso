If you haven't read [Part 1](/blog/2014/03/13/an-evening-well-spent-with-angularjs-and-neo4j-part-1/) yet, I recommend you start there, unless you already now how to set up Yeoman, and are here for the Neo4J stuff.

OK, so the Angular project was up and running, and I had seen the front page. Time to get personal....
